		<p>Let's take another look at that scary looking piece of code that I posted in the intro for this guide.</p>
		
		<div class = "someCode">
			<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/vdorn/p95zjyy6/embed/html,result/"></script>
		</div>
		
		<p>Less scary, I hope. As you can see, we have learned how to call the basic search function for the Spotify Web API to retreive lots of useful information. 
		There are many more things that we can do with this Web API, and I would encourage you to explore some of the track attributes. Try something interesting with 
		the track dancability values. Create playlists based on tracks' acousticness. Once you have figured out a few basic calls to a Web API learning others will be
		 much easier.</p>
		 
		<p>As you homework assignment, I will ask you to try to loop through the preview URLs of all tracks on a given album. How might you have to change your GET request
		 in part 1 of our guide?</p>
