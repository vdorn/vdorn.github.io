		<h2> The Intro</h2>
		
		<p>Well, first off, welcome to the world of web APIs!</p>
		
		<p>This tutorial was created to show you the basics of getting start with using the Spotify Web API.</p>
		
		<p>First off, here is the scary looking thing that we will understand by the end of this tutorial. This code 
		snippet asks the user for an artist as a input. Next, we send that artist name to the Spotify Web API via a GET request. Then, it searches for the first album that returns from the search. 
		After that, it grabs the first track off of the album. Finally, it plays the 30 second preview clip of that track.</p>
