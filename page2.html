		<h1>Part 2: Using Data from the API</h1>
		<h2>and Calling the API again...</h2>
		
		<p>Ok. So, we have received this data from the Spotify Web API. Now what do we do with it?</p>
		
		<div><img src="GetRequest2.JPG"></div>
		<figcaption><center>Fig2. - Returned data from the album GET request.</center></figcaption>
		
		<p>First off, we know that we will be receiving an array of albums from the Spotify database, and we also know
		 that we would like to seach for that album within the database so that we can find the tracks on that album. To do this
		  we will grab the album title from the information we just received and store it in a temporary variable.</p>
		  
		<div class = "someCode"><p>var target = req.albums.items[0].name;</p></div>
		
		<p>This line of code creates the variable target then assigns it the name of the album requested. As you might notice, 
		there is one additional item that we need to traverse through to get to the album name, items[0]. This is the "container" that the 
		Spotify database places around the albums sent back to us, the user. Since we are trying to look at the first album returned to us 
		we will look at items[0].</p>
		
		<p>From here, we will conduct another search within the Spotify database for more information on this album. The search will look very similar 
		to the search that we did for the artists except that the search will be done without using the direct input of the user. We will take this 
		album name that we just grabbed from the request return and pass it along to the Spotify Web API. To do this, we will need to create another 
		request. We will also send the data as we did before, but instead of using the artist= parameter we will use the album= parameter. We will also
		 limit the amount of tracks returned to one, as we will only play back the preview track of the first track on the album.</p>
		
		<div class = "someCode"><p>var req2 = new XMLHttpRequest();</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>req2.open('GET', "https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/" + req.albums.items[0].id + "/tracks?limit=1", true);</p>
		<p>req2.send(null);</p>
		<p>req.addEventListener('load', function(){</p>
			<p>&emsp;if(req2.status >= 200 && req2.status < 400){</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;console.log(JSON.parse(req2.responseText));</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;req2 = JSON.parse(req2.responseText);</p>
			<p>&emsp;}</p>
			<p>&emsp;else{</p>
			<p>	&emsp;&emsp;console.log("Error in network request: " + req2.statusText);</p>
			<p>&emsp;}</p>
		<p>});</p>
		
		</div>
		
		<p>Up next, playing audio using the information we just received...</p>
